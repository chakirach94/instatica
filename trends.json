Engage with Followers</strong></h3><p><strong>Prompt Interactions:</strong> Encourage followers to interact by asking questions, creating polls, or using interactive stickers in your stories.</p><p><strong>Respond Promptly:</strong> Whether it's a direct message or a comment, timely responses can foster a sense of community.</p><h3><strong>3. Use Instagram Features Strategically</strong></h3><p><strong>Stories &amp; Highlights:</strong> These are great tools for sharing short-term content or showcasing the best of your brand through highlight reels.</p><p><strong>Reels:</strong> Instagramâ€™s answer to TikTok, Reels has seen a surge in popularity.

Use tools like Hashtagify to find the best tags for your content.</p><h3><strong>5.
